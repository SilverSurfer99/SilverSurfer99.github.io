        <h1>Ranking all of the MCU Movies(Including Spiderman NWH)</h1>
        <h2> By: John Lezama </h2>
        <div><img id="images0" src="FirstImage.jpg"></div>
        <h2>27th: The Incredible Hulk</h2>
        <div><img id="images" src="TheIncredibleHulk.jpg" alt="Testing"></div>
        <p>Coming last in our list is the Incredible Hulk. Starring Edward Norton as the hulk the 
            Incredible Hulk is not necessarily a bad movie but when compared to all the other amazing
            MCU movies it just can't compete. A whole lot of people, including myself, found ourselves getting 
            tired and bored midway in the movie. And while I have always loved the last fight scene the rest
            of it is definetly below average.
        </p>
        <h2>26th: The Eternals</h2>
        <div><img id="images" src="Eternals.jpg" </div>
        <p>Perhaps this movie will age well, but for now I definetly was not a fan of this movie. There was jut too 
            much going on and there were only a few good characters out of the whole team. I also can't wrap my head around
            the fact that there is just a huge celestial head popping out of the earth that no one is talking about.
        </p>
        <h2>25th: Thor the Dark World</h2>
        <div><img id="images" src="Thor2.jpg"</div>
        <p>There are many flaws in Thor The Dark World.Thor was pretty boring throughout the movie, the Villian Malekith 
            was boring, and they made the relationship between Thor and Jane dreadful to watch. However the movie had Loki, which
            added some much needed humor and personality in this otherwise colorless movie, which is why I ranked it above The Incredible Hulk.

        </p>
        <h2>24th: Black Widow</h2>
        <div><img id="images" src="BlackWidow.jpg" </div>
        <p>While Black Widow was unique and added another genre to the MCU, I didn't enjoy it that much.
            I found myself often getting bored and was confused about it taking place right after Civil War for a 
            little while. I also felt that the way they handled Task Master(her being good at then end not that it was a woman)
            was a waste of a really good villian.
        </p>
        <h2>23rd: Captain Marvel</h2>
        <div><img id="images" src="CaptainMarvel.jpg" </div>
        <p>I did not like Captain Marvel that much. It was a good movie and it definetly got better if you rewatched it
            but ultimately having an ultra powerful, unbalanced hero will have it's consequences, making it focus more on the 
            origin of the hero herself rather than the movie. However I like Talos and Nick Fury as supporting actors, although
            Nick Fury singing the 70's Woman band song will never seem right to me, it is definetly a passable movie.
        </p>
        <h2>22nd: Thor</h2>
        <div><img id="images" src="Thor.jpg"</div>
        <p>Thor by no means is a bad movie, however when compared to these other movies
            it cannot compete. The whole fish out of water trope that they went for in this movie worked very well
            and it introduced us to the best villian in the entire MCU, Loki. I enjoyed many scenes from the "Another!"
            to them fighting in Jotunheim. Unfortunately overrall there were a couple of boring scenes and I easily favor Captain
            America and Iron Man to Thor, at least for now.
        </p>
        <h2>21st: Iron Man 2</h2>
        <div><img id="images" src="IronMan2.jpg"</div>
        <p>While I have always had a soft spot for Iron Man 2. Even I can't overlook some of bad plot choices and 
        plot holes (WHY DIDNT THEY JUST SHOOT WIPLASH AT THE RACE!) however it gave us a lot of screen time of Tony Stark and no matter what movie he's in he is always
        a fantastic character. I also loved the addition of War Machine and the remarkable villian that is Justin Hammer.
        </p>
        <h2>20th: Doctor Strange</h2>
        <div><img id="images" src="DoctorStrange.jpg" </div>
        <p>Doctor Strange is a pretty good movie. It introduced us to a whole new area of Marvel and had some
            really cool effects when it came to the mirror dimension. However a lot of the origin story was similar to
            Iron Man's, a cocky rich jerk goes to a far away place and changes his way's, and after enough rewatches I 
            started to get annoyed of, 'Dormammu I've come to bargain'.
        </p>
        <h2>19th: Ant Man</h2>
        <div><img id="images" src="AntMan.jpg" </div>
        <p> I personally enjoyed Ant Man very much. I really like Scott Lang's character and personality. I also 
            like Hope and Hank Pym as supporting characters and Darren Cross as a villian. Not to mention Louise and his 2 friends,
            I forgot there names, provided some quality humor. What I did not like about this movie was that I got a little
            bored at times and I personally did not like the last fight that much as I felt that while the super tiny scale battle was creative,
            it was also anti-climatic.
        </p>
        <h2>18th: Guardians Of The Galaxy</h2>
        <div><img id="images" src="GOTG.jpg" </div>
        <p>Guardians Of The Galaxy was a very fun movie. It completely came out from left field and while all odds were
            against it, it ended up being a very celebrated movie amongst fans.It had some very fresh humor and a fantastic
            sound track. It also really opened up the universe, much more than Thor ever did and was just a really original, great movie.
            The reason why I rate others above it however is that it hasn't aged the best, not that it aged bad, but after a while some 
            of the movie might feel a little cliche.
        </p>
        <h2>17th: Black Panther</h2>
        <div><img id="images" src="BlackPanther.jpg" </div>
        <p>Black Panther was a very unique and cool movie. It intoduced us to Wakanda, which adds a lot to the 
            MCU as a whole and all the seemingly magical abilities Vibranium was capable of. I also was fine with the 
            final fight scene despite hearing a lot of complaints about the CGI. Killmonger was also a fantastic villian 
            and they were able to make him very menacing despite not having any actual superpowers.
        </p>
        <h2>16th: Shang Chi</h2>
        <div><img id="images" src="ShangChi.jpg" </div>
        <p>Shang Chi was a turning point for phase 4. It was a good origin story! Something that us MCU fans 
            did not have for a while. I really liked the fight scenes and I loved the addition
            of Trevor Slattery in the movie. Not to mention Katy provided great comedy scenes and so did Wong. The only complaint I had was the big CGI fight at the end.
        </p>
        <h2>15th: Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2</h2>
        <div><img id="images" src="GOTG2.jpg" </div>
        <p>Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2 is a very fun movie. It starts off with Baby Groot dancing to Mr.Blue Sky,
            a fantastic scene, and provides lots of humor from Drax, Rocket, and Star-lord. However there are a few noticable
            flaws in the movie as they put A LOT of jokes in the movie and not all of them landed and Ego turning from a good father
            to an evil villian pretty quickly.
        </p>
        <h2>14th: Ant Man and the Wasp</h2>
        <div><img id="images" src="AntMan2.jpg" </div>
        <p>Ant Man and the Wasp was just what audiences needed after the shcocking end of Avengers Infinity War.
            It was a low stakes family movie between Scott Lang, Hope, and Hank Pym. I enjoyed that they made his 
            actions in Civil War have actual consequences in the movie and they didn't choose to ignore it. I also 
            liked Agent Woo and once again Louise and his gang provided some very good quality humor.
        </p>
        <h2>13th: Captain America The Winter Soldier</h2>
            <div><img id="images" src="CaptainAmerica2.jpg" </div>
            <p>While there might be more than a few than you that would place The Winter Soldier higher on this list
                I felt like it was a little too chaotic at times. It took me a few rewatches to fully understand what was happening in the movie 
                but it had a great plot and the theming of the whole spy trust no one thing really made it stand out from the rest
                of the MCU. I also think that this movie has some of the best fight scenes in the MCU.
            </p>
            <h2>12th: Avengers: Infinity War</h2>
            <div><img id="images" src="InfinityWar.jpg" </div>
            <p>Avengers Infinity War was the movie to finally bridge all aspects of the MCU together, except Ant Man
                and Hawkeye, and pit them all against one big villian that they had been developing since 2012's Avengers, 
                Thanos. However why I rated this movie lower than the other Avenger movie's is while there were fantastic scenes
                all throughout the movie, call me a simpleton, but I usually found myself getting a little bored when there were 
                huge gaps between the fight scenes.
            </p>
        <h2>11th: Spider-Man Homecoming</h2>
        <div><img id="images" src="Spiderman.jpg" </div>
        <p>Spiderman Homecoming was a very relaxed, breezy movie which I personally loved. There was no end of the world stakes
            to it but a rather smaller scale city threat to it which is exactly what a Spider-Man movie should be. I also
            loved Iron Man being somewhat of a father figure in the movie and the Vulture made a good villian. 
        </p>
        <h2>10th: Captain America The First Avenger</h2>
        <div><img id="images" src="CaptainAmerica.jpg" </div>
        <p>This is easily one of the best origin stories out there. They perfectly nailed the WW2 setting and society.
            I also loved Colonel Phillips and Doctor Erskine as supporting characters. Another reason I found this movie good was how
            they nailed the boy scout personality of Captain America without making it cheesy and cringey. This movie also had 
            Red Skull which I liked as a villian. The only complaint I had about this movie is that the last fight between Captain America
            and Red Skull was just OK.
        </p>
        <h2>9th: Spider-Man Far From Home</h2>
        <div><img id='images' src='Spiderman2.jpg' </div>
        <p>Spider-Man Far From Home was a movie that when I went to see in the movie theater, I wasn't very satisfied.
            However as time went on and I rewatched it, I found myself enjoying it more and more. It really captured the 
            fact that despite all of the superheroing, Peter Parker is just a teenager. I also thought Mysterio was a pretty
            good villian.
        </p>
        <h2>8th: Spider-Man No Way Home</h2>
        <div><img id="images" src="Spiderman3.jpg" </div>
        <p>No Way Home was a big collosal event no one even knew they were working on. Spanning about 20 years
            of spiderman movies, Tobey Mcguire, Andrew Garfield, and Tom Holland opened the universe to a multiverse.
            Green Goblin was also a very refreshing character as he wasn't a villian with a plan, he just liked the chaos of
            it all. Also the entire plot as a whole was very creative and fun to watch.
        </p>
        <h2>7th: Thor Ragnarok</h2>
        <div><img id="images" src="Thor3.jpg" </div>
        <p>Thor Ragnarok is easily one of the funniest movies in the entire MCU. It was basically Guardians 
            Of The Galaxy Vol.2, but all of the jokes were good. Despite them completeing destroying Thor's character 
            arc, I don't think anyone cared as Thor was not that good of a character before and it gave us and incredible 
            new one.
        </p>
        <h2>6th: Captain America Civil War</h2>
        <div><img id="images" src="CaptainAmerica3.jpg" </div>
        <p>Often considered to be Avengers 2.5 there is very little that Captain America Civil War does wrong.
            I mean the final fight scene between Iron Man, Captain America, and the Winter Soldier was easily one 
            of the most emotional and devastating fight in the entire MCU. Also this movie not only balanced all of these characters, but it also introduced us to
            Black Panther and Spider-Man!
        </p>
        <h2>5th: Iron Man</h2>
        <div><img id="images" src="IronMan1.png" </div>
        <p>Everything about this movie is awesome, I mean just look at the cover. It introduces us to Tony Stark,
        one of the most profitable characters in cinematic history, and kickstarts the MCU. But just looking at the 
        movie by itself there are very few plotholes, the plot is very interesting, at least for me, and the CGI for 2008
        is unbelievable. The only thing that I don't love about this movie is that the villian of this movie, Obadiah Stane,
        could've been handled a lot better as he had big emotional ties to Tony Stark but instead they made them have a big CGI 
        fight which was still really great, but it could've been better.
        </p>
        <h2>4th: Avengers Age Of Ultron</h2>
        <div><img id='images' src="Avengers2.jpg" </div>
        <p>
            I have always felt that Avengers Age Of Ultron has been criminally underrated. While it is on the lower spectrum
            of the Avenger movies it is still nonetheless, an Avenger Movie. While there were bad parts like the wierd Thor
            in that cave scene and Bruce Banner's and Black Widow's relationship, there were also really great scenes like the team
            trying to lift Thor's hammer and the HulkBuster vs Hulk fight. And I know this is an unpopular opinion but I like Ultron's 
            quipping personality as he was made from mainly Tony Stark and due to that, he is a lot like him.
        </p>
        <h2>3rd: Avengers Endgame</h2>
        <div><img id="images" src="Endgame.jpg" </div>
        <p>To be the final movie for 20 plus previous other movies, you have a lot that can go wrong. However
            it was able to give us an ending to Captain America and Iron Man, 2 of the 3 biggest characters
            in the MCU, and make it a quality one. In the end many of us left the movie theater, crying or not, 
            being emotionally satisfied.
        </p>
        <h2>2nd: The Avengers</h2>
        <div><img id="images" src="Avengers.jpg" </div>
        <p>Coming in second in our list is The Avengers. While not all aspects of this movie are better than some of the 
            other ones ranked below, the plot is more than good enough to carry. Not only was this the first movie to ever combine
            previous movies that were very different into one, but they actually made it enjoyable too! From the bickering between the 
            heroes, specifically Iron Man and Captain America, to the awesome CGI fight at the end there is very little to dislike about 
            this movie. However if I had to make one complaint it would be that Captain America seemed a lot stricter and aggresive
            than in his origin story. But that could be excused given that fact that he woke up 70 years later.
        </p>
        <h2>1st: Iron Man 3</h2>
        <div><img id="images" src="IronMan3.jpg" </div>
        <p>First place in our list is none other than Iron Man 3. I have no clue as to why so many people hate this movie. 
             I personally find it to be easily one of the best in the MCU.
            From the PTSD that Tony suffered from New York to the Mandarin being a fake to the epic iron legion scene. I love everything 
            about this movie. The only thing that wasn't great to me was the character arc got a little jumbled from him
            seemingly moving on from Iron Man to him getting right back in it in Age Of Ultron but that really isn't that
            bothersome to me.
